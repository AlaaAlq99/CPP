This contains two implementations of Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm) using singly linked lists and Sequence.

âœ… Features:
Detects if a cycle exists .
Calculates the length of the cycle.
Finds the starting node of the cycle.


ðŸ“š Usage:
This algorithm is very efficient:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
(Does not require extra memory like sets or maps)

ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Detecting infinite loops in data structures
Finding cycles in linked list-based problems
Efficient memory/scheduling in OS & networks
